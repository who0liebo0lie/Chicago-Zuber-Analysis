# Chicago-Zuber-Analysis
Exploration of taxi companies in Chicago.
üöñ Chicago Taxi Companies Analysis

This project explores the operational patterns, trip distribution, and revenue trends among Chicago taxi companies. Using a Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries, the notebook investigates which companies dominate the market, peak travel periods, and other insights derived from taxi trip data. Initial information pulled using SQL from [Chicago Weather 2017 Report](https://practicum-content.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analyst-eng/moved_chicago_weather_2017.html)

üìå About the Project
This notebook performs an analysis of taxi trip data in Chicago, aiming to:

Identify the most active and profitable taxi companies
Examine trip frequency by time of day, day of week, and company
Analyze seasonal and geographical trends in taxi usage
Highlight business opportunities or inefficiencies within the transportation ecosystem
The results can help city planners, business owners, and data scientists better understand urban transportation flows.

üìä Results & Insights
 Zuber is aiming to be a new ride source for the Chicago area. Based on the data from a date in November their lead competitor will be a company called Flash Cab. Unsure if their dominancy is due to the area they service, the number of employees, or types of services they provide (restricting range of rides). Zuber could look into merging/purchasing their company since they have dominance. An even more cost effective way would be to consider purchasing the 3/4th most popular companies (Medallion Leasing or Yellow Cab). The price would be lower and the merge with Zuber would set Zuber up in the neighborhood as direct compeititors. This would help focus efforts on the three most popular areas (The Loop, River North, and Steeterville). These are all high tourist areas. However even in tourist areas the weather will effect the Zuber app. Rides will take longer when there is precipitation.
